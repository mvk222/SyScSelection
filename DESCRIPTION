Description: Quasi-Monte-Carlo algorithm for systematic generation of shock scenarios from an arbitrary multivariate elliptical distribution. The algorithm selects a systematic mesh of arbitrary fineness that approximately evenly covers an isoprobability ellipsoid in d dimensions. (Flood, Mark D. & Korenko, George G. "Systematic Scenario Selection", Office of Financial Research Working Paper #0005, 2013)
  This package is the 'R' analogy to the 'Matlab' code published by Flood & Korenko in above-mentioned paper.
